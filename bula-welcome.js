/* Bula welcome button — Dimau Fintech apps.
 * One file, copied into every app. Load with:
 *   <script src="/bula-welcome.js" data-app="soli-fiji" defer></script>
 * Any element with [data-bula-open] becomes the live welcome button.
 * If the page has none, a floating "Bula! Welcome to …" pill is added.
 * Optional: data-mount="brand" puts the pill beside the app's logo in its header (short "Bula!" on phones),
 *   or data-mount="after:<css>", "before:<css>" or "in:<css>" places it next to / inside that element. Falls back to floating if neither is found.
 * Optional: data-mount-2 names the element the button sits under when the header row has no room
 *   (default: straight under that row).
 * Optional: data-share adds a Share button beside the pill (uses the Dimau share chooser when the page loads it).
 * Optional: data-position="bottom-left|bottom-right|top-left|top-right", data-offset="72" (px from edge).
 * No inline scripts or styles are used, so strict Content-Security-Policy headers are fine.

It is not your real score or a lender’s decision.","my credit score":"Start here for the sample score, its band and the factors used in this demonstration. Open each factor to understand the example breakdown.","my credit report":"This screen groups the sample accounts, credit checks, addresses and public-record information. None of these records comes from a real consumer credit file.","credit report":"A credit report groups account and repayment information. This report uses invented records so you can explore the layout safely.","accounts":"This counts the sample credit accounts included in the report. Open an account to inspect its example balance, limit, status and repayment history.","open accounts":"These are the sample accounts marked open. A closed account can still appear separately in the example report.","total balances":"This is the sum of the balances shown on the sample accounts. It represents amounts outstanding in this demonstration, not money held in a bank account.","card utilisation":"Utilisation compares the balance on a card with its available credit limit. For example, a balance of 200 against a limit of 1,000 uses 20% of that limit. The dashboard’s figures are illustrative.","hard searches (12m)":"The example count covers application-related checks within a twelve-month period. It is different from a soft check. These are sample events, not actual searches of your file.","searches (12m)":"This summarises example credit checks over twelve months. Open the search detail to see the organisation, date and whether the example is marked hard or soft.","public records":"This area demonstrates where judgments, insolvencies or bankruptcies would be listed in a report. An empty sample section is not a verification of your legal or financial history.","credit accounts":"Each row is a sample loan, card or other credit account. Select a row to see its balance, limit and monthly repayment record. Read the legend before interpreting its colours.","search footprint":"This lists sample organisations that checked the example file. The hard/soft label explains the type of search; dates show when the example event occurred.","who's checked me":"Review the example search footprint here. No bank or other organisation has checked your real credit file through this demo.","address history":"The example report shows addresses and the dates associated with them. These invented addresses demonstrate how current and previous records can be displayed.","addresses on file":"View the sample address history. Open a row to see its details. This prototype does not retrieve or verify your actual address.","score over time":"Follow the example score across months. The chart shows changes within this synthetic dataset, not a prediction of future borrowing decisions.","fjscore over time":"Read the horizontal axis for the month and the vertical axis for the example score. Open a point or its detail where available to inspect the figure.","score milestones":"These markers describe notable moments in the example score history. They are milestones in the sample data, not achievements recorded for you.","what's affecting your score":"The prototype groups the inputs that contribute to the example score. A displayed weight describes this model’s emphasis, not a guarantee that a lender uses the same formula.","payment history":"This factor illustrates whether repayments in the sample data arrived on time. Read the monthly legend and account detail together rather than relying on colour alone.","credit utilisation":"This factor compares sample card balances and limits. The percentage changes as either value changes; the example is for understanding the model.","loans & cards i can get":"Browse illustrative products and eligibility estimates. No application is sent and no lender has approved you. Product names, rates and likelihoods in this prototype are not live offers.","eligibility checker":"The checker demonstrates how an eligibility screen could work using sample data. It does not assess your real circumstances, perform a credit search or promise acceptance.","what you can get":"These are example product matches. Read the displayed assumptions; they are not current lending offers or approvals.","improve my score":"Explore the suggested actions attached to the example report. They explain the prototype’s factors; no specific score increase or real-world outcome is guaranteed.","boost your score":"This section demonstrates possible actions related to the sample score. Open an item for its explanation and treat any projected change as illustrative.","track your progress":"This shows progress within the demonstration. It does not monitor or change a real credit file.","recent alerts":"These example notifications show how a customer might learn about a new search, changed balance or other update. They are not real account alerts.","all alerts":"Review the sample changes in one place. Open an alert to understand its example event and date.","changes to my file":"This is the sample alert feed. It helps you explore the information a change notification can contain, without monitoring real records.","new hard search detected":"This is a simulated application-related credit check. No real search took place. The reporting workflow demonstrates how a customer might flag an unfamiliar event.","cyclone protection active":"This demonstrates a proposed disaster-protection state in the prototype. It does not confirm protection for a real account or a policy adopted by any lender.","balance reduced":"An example account balance has decreased relative to the previous sample record. It is not a payment confirmation or a change to your real finances.","report an error":"Explore how to identify an account and describe a suspected mistake in the sample report. This demo does not send a complaint to a lender or credit bureau.","raise a dispute":"Choose the sample record and reason, then describe the example correction. Use fictional details only. This prototype does not create a real dispute.","your disputes":"These are example dispute records and statuses. They demonstrate a tracking screen; they do not establish that an organisation received or investigated a complaint.","account (optional)":"Choose a sample account if your example dispute relates to that account. Leave it unselected for an issue affecting another part of the report.","reason":"Choose the category that best describes the example error, then add fictional details explaining the expected correction.","details":"Describe the sample issue clearly: what is shown and what should be different. Do not enter real account numbers, identity documents or private financial information.","submit dispute":"This demonstrates submitting a dispute within the prototype. It does not deliver a real complaint to a lender or start a formal investigation.","your details":"The profile contains sample identity and contact details. It is not a verified identity record.","preferences":"Explore the example notification and contact choices. Changing them here does not subscribe you to a live credit-monitoring service.","my details & preferences":"Open the sample profile and preference controls. Use fictional data while testing.","email":"Use the supplied demo account to explore the interface. A real email address is not needed for the sample dashboard.","password":"The demo credentials are supplied on the sign-in screen. Do not reuse a password from another account. Help never reads this field’s value.","sign in":"Open the sample dashboard with the demo credentials. This is an interface demonstration, not access to a real credit file.","create a free account":"This is a prototype account-entry control. It does not establish a licensed credit-bureau account or verify a real identity.","open navigation":"Open the menu to move between the score, report, accounts, searches, alerts and profile. Choosing a page does not submit a credit application.","open account menu":"Open the profile menu for the available account options and sign-out control.","share bula score link":"Open the share chooser for the public app link. Review the destination before sending; sharing the app link does not share your entered form values."},"soli-fiji":{"discover":"Browse the sample campaigns and their stated purpose. Open a campaign to read its story, target and updates before comparing it with others.","donate":"This area demonstrates giving to a campaign. Donations are different from repayable loans or ownership investments. Real payments remain unavailable in this pilot.","lend":"This area demonstrates repayable community funding. Review the example repayment terms and risks. It is not an active lending offer.","invest":"This area demonstrates raising capital in exchange for an interest in a venture. Example returns and valuations are not guarantees, and investing is not live.","ledger":"A ledger lists example money movements so you can compare incoming and outgoing amounts. The sample entries are not evidence of real transfers.","map":"Explore the locations attached to sample campaigns. Select a marker to open its campaign; the map is a discovery aid, not a land-title or ownership record.","leaders":"This view compares the activity shown in the pilot dataset. It is not an independent verification of a person, campaign or organisation.","raised":"This is the funding amount displayed for the example campaign. Compare it with the target and stage; it is not confirmation that real money was collected.","target":"The target is the amount the example campaign aims to raise. It is distinct from the amount already shown as raised.","your account":"Explore the pilot’s account area and sample activity. Payments, lending, investing and identity verification are not enabled for real use."},"fiji-tap":{"tap to pay":"Try the simulated payment flow. The demonstration shows the steps between a shopper and merchant; it does not charge a card or transfer money.","personal account":"Explore the sample shopper balance, spending and payment history. These figures do not represent funds you can withdraw or spend.","merchant account":"Explore how a shop could review a simulated payment. A success screen in this demo is not proof that funds settled.","balance":"This is a demonstration balance. It is different from an actual bank or mobile-wallet balance and cannot be spent.","amount":"Enter the amount to use in the simulation and check the currency shown. This does not authorise a real payment.","payment history":"Review the demonstration transactions and their displayed statuses. They are sample records, not bank statements.","builds your credit":"This illustrates the proposed link between payment activity and a credit history. The demo does not report your activity to a credit bureau."},"fijilearn":{"daily review":"Practise previously introduced ideas in a short review. Read the feedback after each answer and try again where needed.","five subjects":"Choose Maths, English, Science, Social Studies or Vosa Vakaviti to see the available learning material.","for teachers":"Use the teacher view to review the class progress made available by the app. A class code connects a learner to a class; check the code with the teacher.","class code":"Enter the code supplied by your teacher for the intended class. Check its spelling before joining.","progress":"Progress indicates the lessons or steps completed in the app. It is a learning aid rather than a formal assessment or qualification.","streak":"A streak tracks consecutive learning activity as counted by the app. Missing a day does not erase the knowledge you have gained.","certificates":"These recognise activity completed in the app. They are not an accredited school qualification.","maths":"Choose a course, work through one step at a time and read the explanation after each answer.","review":"Revisit the material and its feedback. Repeated practice can help you notice which steps need more attention."},"fiji-homes":{"homes and lots":"Browse the housing pipeline and model homes.

Landowner-facing land-book work is in the separate Qele app.","feasibility model":"Compare a development’s assumed costs and revenues. Change one input at a time and inspect the resulting totals. Estimates need real quotes before they support a decision.","grants":"Explore the grant information and calculator assumptions shown on this page. Eligibility and availability need confirmation with the relevant provider.","register interest":"Use this form to express interest in the project described. An expression of interest is not a reservation, purchase contract or guarantee of allocation.","costs":"These are the development cost assumptions used by the model. Check the currency, quantity, timing and whether tax is included.","returns":"These are modelled outcomes based on the displayed assumptions. They are not guaranteed income or a formal property valuation."},"my-debt-calculator":{"all your debts":"Add each debt separately so balances, rates and minimum payments can be compared. Check the units and payment frequency before relying on the totals.","balance":"Enter the outstanding balance for this debt. This is the amount still owed, not the credit limit or original amount borrowed.","interest rate":"Use the rate and time period requested by this field. A monthly rate and an annual rate are different; check your statement before entering a figure.","minimum payment":"This is the amount assumed to be payable for the period shown. Check the actual minimum and due date with the lender.","your payoff plan":"Compare repayment scenarios using the model’s assumptions. Changing the extra-payment amount shows a new estimate; it does not arrange or make payments.","money saved":"The model compares estimated interest under its scenarios. Savings depend on the rates, balances and payments entered and are not guaranteed.","most expensive first":"This approach prioritises the debt with the greatest interest cost under the model. Review all minimum payments and obligations before using a plan.","private":"The calculator’s published description says your numbers stay on your device.

Confirm entitlement and current scheme terms through the official service process before committing to a purchase.","mortgage":"Compare the estimated borrowing and repayment figures. These calculations are planning illustrations, not a mortgage offer or affordability approval.","deposit":"The deposit is the part of the purchase price funded upfront. Keep it separate from legal, moving and other purchase costs when checking your budget.","all the costs":"Review each purchase cost included by the calculator. Estimates can change by property, location and transaction; check the displayed assumptions and actual quotes.","overpayments":"Compare what happens in the model if you pay more than the regular instalment. Check the lender’s limits and charges before making real overpayments.","stamp duty":"This is a planning calculation using the page’s assumptions. Tax treatment depends on the property and buyer circumstances; verify the current official rules before exchange.","salary":"Enter the pay figure requested by the field and check whether it expects an annual or monthly amount. The estimate does not confirm scheme entitlement.","compare":"Compare properties or scenarios using consistent assumptions. A lower estimated monthly payment does not by itself mean a lower total cost."},"fiji-culture-corner":{"heritage pieces":"Browse concepts inspired by Fijian design.
